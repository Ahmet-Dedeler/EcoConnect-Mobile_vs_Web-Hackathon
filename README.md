# EcoConnect

## Inspiration
I got inspired to build EcoConnect when I thought if there was an app that allowed the users to **connect** with each other and have resources about **sustainability** and **eco-friendliness**. It took on from there.

## What it does
**EcoConnect** connects companies, students, and people to the resources they need to take meaningful action towards a great future. 

Our platform provides a one-stop-shop for sustainability solutions, including educational resources, networking opportunities, and access to sustainable products and services.

## How I built it
I built **EcoConnect** using **python** with **flask**, **html**, and **css**. I also used **Auth0** for user authentication. I integrated Auth0 into my flask application and built the user interface with html and css

## Challenges I ran into
I ran into some challenges when I just started building out EcoConnect, I had no idea how I would make the websites layout and how it would work. I decided to go along with it and just create some code and it advanced from there.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud that the website turned out great. When I just started with Auth0 it was confusing at first but it was actually very easy and fun, and I'm happy I got to achieve that. And It was cool to see how my project turned out in the end.

## What I learned
I got to use parts of html and css that I've never used before and learned a bunch of new stuff. I learned how to integrate APIs with Flask and have a complete web app. It was also fun to try out a new technology like **Auth0** and really explore the capabilities. 

## What's next for EcoConnect
I hope to advance the project by adding more sections and improving the website even more. There is a lot of potential to make EcoConnect a place for everyone. I also plan to have a database of accounts registered so the users can connect with each other seamlessly.
